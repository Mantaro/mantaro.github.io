### Source

Mantaro (and it's API) is fully free and open source software. 
You can share and modify (in a fork) the source within the terms of the [GNU GPL v3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license.

The source for the bot can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot), and the source for the [API](https://github.com/Mantaro/mantaro-api/) aswell. 
Any libraries we release for the better functionality of the bot will always be released under free licenses, such as [imageboard-api](https://github.com/Kodehawa/imageboard-api). 
We're commited to open source development and to make the scene better for everyone making bots.

The source for this website is also available [here](https://github.com/Mantaro/mantaro.github.io/).

This website uses the [minimal theme by orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal), and it's hosted on Github Pages. 
The license of the theme and of the website is CC-BY-SA-3.0 (Unported). All content on this website is static. 

You're welcome to make Pull Requests to improve the bot or it's systems/libraries.

### Page Javascript

This website uses javascript only for the dark/light theme switch. It *should* be LibreJS compatible and it's licensed under the CC-BY-SA-3.0 license. You can see the (pretty bad) javascript code used to do such [here](https://github.com/Mantaro/mantaro.github.io/blob/master/assets/script.js).
